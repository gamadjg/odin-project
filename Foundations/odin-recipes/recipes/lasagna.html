        <li>1/4 cup, grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees, coat pan with olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook onions and garlic in oil 
            until tender and semi-transparent. Stir in mushrooms, and cook until soft. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a sauce pan, combine spinach and 1/4 cup water. Cover, and cook over medium 
            heat until wilted. Drain. In a large bowl, mix together spinach, onion mixture, and ricotta cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a frying pan, brown moose meat over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. 
            When the pink color is almost gone, stir in the cocoa and brown sugar. This removes the gamey-ness. 
            Once the meat is well browned, drain to remove excess grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and water, 
            and season with oregano, Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer. 
            Arrange a single layer of oven ready noodles over the sauce. Spread one half of the ricotta cheese 
            mixture over the noodles, and top with some of the tomato sauce and a sprinkle of parmesan and mozzarella cheese. 
            Repeat with remaining ingredients, ending with a generous layer of mozzarella cheese. Cover pan with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 45 minutes, or until lasagna is hot and bubbly.
        </li>
    </ol>
